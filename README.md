ledani
================================================================================

A way to automatically indicate who is home.

There are two parts to the project: a poller which checks for people's
phones on a wifi network, and a physical widget to display the state.

There might be an optional server that helps identify who's phone
belongs to who, but as it stands that's not going to make it into v1.

ETYMOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name comes from the indicator method (LEDs) and the lojban zdani (home).
